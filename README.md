# Ping-Pong
Ping-Pong demo

This is my own prototype of the well-known game "Ping-pong". It was created in the Python programming language using the Pygame library

The essence of the game: There are two rackets for two players and a ball that must be hit like in tennis. Whoever misses the ball loses.
